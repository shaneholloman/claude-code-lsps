# Claude Code LSPs

This repository contains a [Claude Code marketplace](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces) with plugins that offer LSP servers for TypeScript, Rust, Python, Go, Java, Kotlin, C/C++, PHP, Ruby, C#, PowerShell, and HTML/CSS.  [LSP servers](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol) provide powerful and familiar code intelligence features to IDEs, and now Claude Code directly.

[**Claude Code is going to officially support LSP soon.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1otdfo9/lsp_is_coming_to_claude_code_and_you_can_try_it)  In 2.0.30 (October 31st) they adding the working beginnings of a system to run LSP servers from plugins automatically on startup, and an `LSP` tool (enable via `$ENABLE_LSP_TOOL=1`) that Claude can use to
- Go to the definition for symbols (`goToDefinition`)
- Hover over symbols (`hover`)
- List all the symbols in a file (`documentSymbol`)
- Find all references to a symbol (`findReferences`)
- Search for symbols across the workspace (`workspaceSymbol`)

> [!warning]
> Support for LSP in Claude Code is pretty raw still.  There are bugs in the different LSP operations, no documention, and no UI indication that your LSP servers are started/running/have errors or even exist.  But it's there, and with [tweakcc](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/tweakcc) you can make it work.

## Patching Claude Code

You can manually patch it, but it's much easier to use [tweakcc](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/tweakcc) to automatically detect your Claude Code installation (npm or native) apply the necessary patches.

Run `npx tweakcc --apply`.  It will automatically patch your Claude Code installation to make LSP support usable.  (It also does a bunch of other things like let you customize all the system prompt parts, create new CC themes, change the thinking verbs, and a lot more.)

If you'd like to apply the patches yourself, go the bottom of this page.

## Installing the plugins

Install them the usual way.  First make CC aware of the marketplace:
1. Run `claude`
2. `/plugin marketplace add Piebald-AI/claude-code-lsps`

Then enable the plugins of your choice:
1. Run `claude`
2. Type `/plugins`
3. Choose `Browse and install plugins`
4. Enter the `Claude Code Language Servers` marketplace
5. Select the plugins you'd like with the spacebar (e.g. TypeScript, Rust)
6. Press "i" to install them
7. Restart Claude Code

## Language-specific setup instructions

You need to install various components in order for the plugins to use them:

<details>
<summary>Rust (<code>rust-analyzer</code>)</summary>

Uses `rust-analyzer`, the official modern Rust Language Server and the same one used by the official VS Code extension.  If you have `rustup`, installing `rust-analyzer` is easy:

```bash
rustup component add rust-analyzer
```

The `rust-analyzer` executable needs to be in your PATH.

</details>

<details>
<summary>JavaScript/TypeScript (<code>vtsls</code>)</summary>

Install **vtsls** and `typescript` packages globally:
```bash
# npm
npm install -g @vtsls/language-server typescript

# pnpm
pnpm install -g @vtsls/language-server typescript

# bun
bun install -g @vtsls/language-server typescript
```
Make sure the `vtsls` executable is in your PATH.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Python (<code>pyright</code>)</summary>

Install **pyright** for its speed and excellent type checking:
```bash
# npm
npm install -g pyright

# pnpm
pnpm install -g pyright

# bun
bun install -g pyright
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>Go (<code>gopls</code>)</summary>

Install **gopls**, the official Go language server:
```bash
go install golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest

curl -LO http://download.eclipse.org/jdtls/snapshots/jdt-language-server-latest.tar.gz
mkdir -p ~/jdtls
tar -xzf jdt-language-server-latest.tar.gz -C ~/jdtls

# Or install via package manager (varies by OS)
# macOS with Homebrew:
brew install jdtls
```

Set `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to Java 21+ installation.

</details>

<details>

curl -L https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn/releases/latest/download/omnisharp-linux-x64-net6.0.tar.gz | tar xz -C ~/.local/bin

# Ensure the OmniSharp executable is in your PATH
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>PowerShell (<code>powershell-editor-services</code>)</summary>
